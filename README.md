## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used `progress` element for the progress bar, in this project.
I learned that styling and animating the `progress` element is not easy. Javascript is needed to animate a `progress` element.

A progress bar can be created using a `div` and a `span` within. Which makes it easy for styling and animation and also works across different browsers.

### Continued development

I would like to learn about best way to style and animate a cross-platform progress bar.

### Useful resources

The two articles below helped me learn about using and styling `progress` element.

- [The HTML5 progress Element](https://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/)

- [CSS tooltip generator](https://css-generators.com/tooltip-speech-bubble/) - A tooltip generator that was useful in this project.
